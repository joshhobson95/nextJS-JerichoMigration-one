              <p>The USDA Plant Hardiness Zone Map is an essential tool for gardeners in New Mexico and beyond, helping determine which plants are most likely to thrive in a specific region based on average annual minimum winter temperatures. By identifying your zone—most of Albuquerque, for example, falls within Zones 7a to 7b—you can make informed choices about which trees, shrubs, perennials, and vegetables are best suited to your local climate. This map serves as a helpful starting point for both new and experienced gardeners planning resilient, climate-appropriate landscapes.</p>
